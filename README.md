# ItemMaster
Front-end script for general handling of Minecraft items in the Figura mod.

# How to install:

The "avatar" folder in the repo contains a script that you move into your avatar, that is the script runner (and optionally the updater).

If you have the Networking API enabled and you whitelisted "api.github.com" and "raw.githubusercontent.com" in Figura settings, when you run the avatar, ItemMaster will prompt you to enable auto-updating to be able to keep itself up to date, which includes the first-time installation needed for it to function, if you do not want to auto-update, you can install ItemMaster manually.

# Manual installation:

If you do not want this script to do any networking, you can simply move the "assets" folder from the repository into "figura/data/ItemMaster/.." (should be "figura/data/ItemMaster/assets"). Doing so will make ItemMaster not prompt you about auto-updating.
