# ItemMaster
Front-end script for general handling of Minecraft items in the Figura mod.

# How to install:

The "avatar" folder in the repo should go in your "figura/avatars/.." 

If you have Networking enabled and you whitelisted "api.github.com" and "https://raw.githubusercontent.com" in Figura settings, when you run the avatar, ItemMaster will install itself in your "figura/data" folder. The avatar's script can be located in any of your avatars and it will function as intended.
